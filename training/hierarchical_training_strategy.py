"""Hierarchical Training Strategy Module for CapibaraGPT.

This module provides hierarchical training strategy functionality for organizing
and coordinating training across multiple model tiers and expert levels. It enables
structured training pipelines with hierarchical expert organization.

The hierarchical strategy features:
- Multi-tier expert organization
- Cascading training workflows
- Level-based model specialization
- Coordinated training across hierarchy levels

Example:
    Basic usage (when implementation is complete):

    >>> from capibara.training.hierarchical_training_strategy import (
    ...     HierarchicalTrainer,
    ...     TrainingHierarchy
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> # Define training hierarchy
    >>> hierarchy = TrainingHierarchy(
    ...     levels=["foundation", "specialized", "expert"],
    ...     coordination_strategy="bottom_up"
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> # Train across hierarchy
    >>> trainer = HierarchicalTrainer(hierarchy)
    >>> results = trainer.train(model, data)

Note:
    TODO: Implement HierarchicalTrainer and TrainingHierarchy classes.
    This module is currently a placeholder for future hierarchical training
    strategy implementation. The main functionality will be added as the
    training system evolves.
