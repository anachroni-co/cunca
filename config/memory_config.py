"""
Memory Configuration - Memory and compute optimization settings.

This module provides configuration dataclasses for memory optimization,
mixed precision, and parallelism settings used across CapibaraGPT models.

Key Components:
    - MemoryOptimizationConfig: Main configuration dataclass

Features:
    - Gradient checkpointing and rematerialization
    - Memory monitoring and thresholds
    - Mixed precision (BF16/FP32)
    - Model and data parallelism
    - Dynamic batch sizing
